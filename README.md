## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Morteza,

I'm a flexible learner and detail-oriented individual with valuable experience in different fields such as Web Developing, Deep learning, Networking...<br>
As a boy with teamwork character, I always work side by side with a team in all companies at which I have worked.<br>
I extremely enjoy new experiences and challenges. In other words, I prefer to follow new challenges instead of routine works. The quote "Either try as hard as you wish or wish as hard as you try" has been always my motto.<br>
By the way reputation for hard-working, creativity, problem solving and team working are the highlights of my character.
